{"3020017": "And if a man shall take his sister, his father\u2019s daughter, or his mother\u2019s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister\u2019s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity."}
