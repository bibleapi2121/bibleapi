{"23031004": "For thus hath the spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof."}
